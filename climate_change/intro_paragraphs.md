## Introduction

This exercise aims to compare and contrast the CO2 emissions of four countries in the world: Canada, United Kingdom, Taiwan, and Japan. I chose these four countries because they are on opposite sides of the globe (and I was just curious about Taiwan), and I wanted to see if this would affect their CO2 emissions. I am also curious at the relationship between CO2 emissions and GDP as well as the relationship between energy consumption and GDP, so this is something that I will be exploring. In the data visualization, I will mainly be studying the ratio of CO2 per GDP of the four countries mentioned above, by year. CO2 is measured in million tonnes, while GDP is measured in 2011 international dollars (which is roughly equivalent to what the US dollar equaled 2011). I also explore the ratio of energy and GDP in the paragraph below, and energy is measured in kilowatt-hours.
