## Introduction

This exercise aims to compare and contrast the CO2 emissions of four countries in the world: Canada, United Kingdom, Taiwan, and China. I chose these four countries because they are on opposite sides of the globe (and I was just curious about Taiwan), and I wanted to see if this would affect their CO2 emissions. I am also curious at the relationship between CO2 emissions and GDP as well as the relationship between energy consumption and GDP, so this is something that I will be exploring.
